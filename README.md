# Correlation-in-Python
Welcome to the Movie Database Exploration and Correlation project! This repository contains Python code using the Pandas library along with matplotlib and seaborn to explore  a dataset obtained from Kaggle, focusing on understanding the correlations between different columns and their impact on the gross collection or earnings of movies and visualizing all the results obtained in a creative and easy to understand way.
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes comprehensive information about various movies. The dataset comprises multiple columns, providing details such as movie title, genre, budget, revenue, ratings, and more.
Project Highlights-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized Pandas for in-depth exploration of the dataset.
Correlation Analysis: Investigated correlations between different factors and the gross collection of movies.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and prepared the data for analysis.
Visualization: Created informative visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to enhance the understanding of the dataset.
